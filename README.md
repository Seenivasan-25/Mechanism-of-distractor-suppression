An Experimental Approach to Measure Attention Using Singleton Distractors
📌 Overview

This project explores an experimental approach to measure human attention using singleton distractors. The study investigates how distractors influence visual attention by analyzing reaction times and error rates under controlled experimental conditions.

🎯 Objectives

To examine how attention is captured by singleton distractors.

To measure the impact of distractors on reaction time and accuracy.

To identify significant differences in attention performance across conditions.

To contribute insights to psychological and computational models of attention.

🧪 Methodology

Developed experiments in MATLAB to simulate tasks with and without distractors.

Conducted trials where participants identified targets under different scenarios.

Collected reaction time and error rate data from participants.

Performed statistical analysis and data visualization in R.

📊 Results

Reaction times increased significantly in the presence of singleton distractors.

Error rates were higher when distractors closely resembled the target.

Results confirm that attention is automatically captured by salient distractors.
